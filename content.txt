Hi, I am learning programming.  
I use Node.js to run JavaScript on my computer.  
The fs module helps me read and write files.  
With readFile, I can read a file in a simple way.  
It is non-blocking, so my program does not stop.  
This makes Node.js fast and useful for many tasks.  
I am happy to practice and improve my skills.  
Learning step by step makes coding easy for me.
